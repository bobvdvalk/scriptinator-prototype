:library_name: HTTP

= HTTP
:type_name: HTTP

The `HTTP` library allows you to perform HTTP requests. It is equipped with some utilities to allow for simple use of
json web APIs. You can perform HTTP requests by calling the `HTTP` functions directly, or by creating a reusable
<<HttpClient>> with which you can perform multiple requests.

== HttpClient
:type_name: HttpClient

The `HttpClient` is used to perform HTTP requests. To make requests you have two options:

1. Call the `get`, `head`, `post`, `delete`, `put`, `patch` and `request` functions directly on the `HTTP` library.
   This will create a new client for every request which causes some overhead, but requires less boilerplate.

2. Use `HTTP.client()` to create a client and reuse that for your requests. This method introduces less overhead.
   Creating a client also allows you to specify options such as authentication methods. This causes those options
   to be applied to all requests you make using this client.

== HttpResponse
:type_name: HttpResponse

An `HttpResponse` is the result of one of the request methods. It contains various headers and types of <<HttpResponseBody, response bodies>>
which are exposed by convenient methods.

=== HttpResponse.code

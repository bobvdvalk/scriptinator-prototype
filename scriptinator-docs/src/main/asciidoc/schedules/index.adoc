= Schedules

Schedules allow you to run parameterized scripts at given intervals.
They are configured on a project level, at the `Schedules` tab.
A minimal schedule requires a name, script and cron expression to run.
One schedule can trigger a single script, but a script can be referenced by multiple schedules.

Scriptinator has a scheduler that runs every N seconds.
This scheduler checks for schedules that are enabled and scheduled to be run in the past,
and processes them.
Since the scheduler can only run periodically,
schedules are unlikely to be processed at the exact time they are scheduled to run.
This means that the minimum interval at which a schedule runs is the interval at which the scheduler runs.

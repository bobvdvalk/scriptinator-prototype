h| Description h| Cron expression h| Notes

| Every minute
| `0 * * * * ?`
| This is one of the most simple schedules.
  The first 0 indicates the schedule should be triggered at second 0 of the minute.
  All other signs are wildcards.

| Every Saturday at noon
| `0 0 12 ? * SAT` +
  +
  `0 0 12 ? * 7`
| Days of the week can be specified either by its first 3 letters or its index.
  The days are 1-indexed and a weeks start on a Sunday, so 1=SUN, 2=MON, etc.

| Every 6 hours
| `0 0 0/6 * * ?` +
  +
  `0 0 0,6,12,18 * * ?`
| Both these notations function exactly the same.
  The only difference is that the bottom one is more verbose.
  If you want the schedule to be offset, simply replace the 0 before the slash with the offset.

| Wednesday through Sunday at 8 in the evening
| `0 0 20 ? * WED-SUN` +
  +
  `0 0 20 ? * 4-7,1`
| When specifying a range of days by their short notation you can wrap around the week,
  i.e. from Saturday to Sunday.
  This is not possible when using their index.

| On December 31st at 23:45
| `00 45 23 L DEC ?` +
  +
  `00 45 23 31 DEC ?`
| The L in this notation indicates that is has to be the last day of the month.
  Because December always has 31 days we can also explicitly specify that it has to be day 31.

[WARNING]
Currently specifying a value in both day of month and day of week does not work.
Instead, a `?` must be used in one of these fields.

|===
h| Character h| Position h| Description

| `*`
| Any
| A wildcard that matches all values.

| `-`
| Any
| Used to specify a range, for example `1-14` or `MON-FRI`.

| `,`
| Any
| Used to specify multiple values, for example `7,1` or `SAT,SUN`.
  The values can also include ranges, like: `3,14-20`

| `/`
| Any
| Used to specify increments.
  For example: `0/6` as the hour part would mean every 6th hour starting from 0,
  i.e.: 0, 6, 12 and 18.
  This value can be offset by putting a different number before the `/`,
  for example `2/6` would mean hours 2, 8, 14 and 20.

| `?`
| Day of month +
  Day of week
| Indicates no specific value.
  This is used when you need to specify a value in either day of month or day of week,
  but not the other.

1.2+| `L`
| Day of month
| The last day of the month.

| Day of week
| If used by itself, this means the last day of the week (Saturday).
  It can also be used to specify the last x-day of the month,
  for example: `2L` means the last Monday of the month.

| `W`
| Day of month
| The weekday nearest to the given day,
  for example: `10W` means the weekday nearest to the 10th of the month.
  If that day would be a Saturday, the nearest weekday would be the Friday before.
  Note however that this does not cross month boundaries.
  That means that if that Friday before is also the month before,
  next Monday will be used instead.

| `#`
| Day of week
| Used to indicate the nth x-day of the month,
  for example: `2#1` or `MON#1` means the first Monday of the month.

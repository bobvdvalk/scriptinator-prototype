= HTTP

The `HTTP` library allows you to perform HTTP requests. It is equipped with some utilities to allow for simple use of
json web APIs.

== HttpClient

The `HttpClient` allows you to perform the actual requests. You can create a new client using `HTTP.client` or
automatically create a new client using one of the root level functions.

=== `HttpClient.get`


Perform an `HTTP GET` request. This method is a shortcut for calling <<HttpClient.request>> using `"GET"` as the
`method` parameter.

```javascript

=== `HttpClient.head`

=== `HttpClient.post`

=== `HttpClient.delete`

=== `HttpClient.put`

=== `HttpClient.patch`

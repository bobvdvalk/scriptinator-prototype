Thank you for considering making a contribution to Scriptinator. It seems like you came in so early we haven't even
written any contribution guidelines yet.

Conventions
***********

We like to adhere to certain conventions when it comes to code and documentation. This helps us work together on a
uniform codebase and allows us to focus on the actual work instead of deciphering confusing contributions.

Documentation
=============

All our documentation is written in `reStructuredText`. It is built and published through `Read the Docs`_.

Headers
-------

`reStructuredText` allows you to use your own header convention. To make sure we all use the same, these are the ones
we picked:

.. code-block:: restructuredtext
